As women and men of science, we've dedicated our time and energy on discovering the world around us. Stemming from our observations are sets of laws and equations.
As engineers, we root our thinking in those discoveries to answer practical problems. We build new tools to make us reach the distance.
We devise inventions to fill our basic needs. We assemble these inventions into bigger structures to make possible what nobody thought would be.
We have the power to build structures that will stand the test of time. Today, the whole world is in reach within this devise you read that article on.
Yet, we are only at the dawn of a beautiful journey. We don't fully understand the universe yet, most of the big problems that lay before us are still
invisible to us. Even our intuition would dismiss them. Our emotion always gets us back to earth, but it is crutial for us to reason beyond a feeling. We need
to stop solving obvious problems and start working on those that defy common sense. Let's stop solving problems that solve problems!
