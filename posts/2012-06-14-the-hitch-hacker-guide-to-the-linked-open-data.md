sjezpz:192034 - but http://sajrmajaz.zlzpp.com/zedze/192034 really - or, as its friends like to call it, 192034, was a happy yet curious datum.
Like a lot of data, it liked to be thought about as a resource; "I am resourceful" he was heard saying a lot. 192034 had a lot of humour, too.
He was famous around his entourage as a witful pun maker. 192033, 192034's brother kept on complaining that "He isn't that funny."

Funny or not, resourceful for sure, 192034 was a whimsical being. It attracted other data like a magnet. Was it due to his charisma? He doubtlessly
had an aura. Data would come and link themselve to 192034. His circle of aquaintance became larger and larger. Some might call him a leader. "I don't
put sugar in my coffee," he liked to say. He was a datum that liked things for what they were. For him, the cup of coffee was always half-full.
An optimist humanist, but instead of human, data. He realized that data are more than just values; he had nothing against couples,
but believed in triples instead. Like most knowledgable datum, 192034 owned an owl. A beautiful one. "It gives me meaning," he said. When he took
it to the owl-er coaster, he "could see SPARQL" in its eyes.

Yet, this guide isn't about 192034. Not even about his brother, 192034. It isn't either about their good friends 192011, 192289 and 19290, although it would be
possible to write a good deal about the latter and its constant discontented manners. This guide isn't either about their direct referencial---home---sjezpz.
The reach of this guide aims to go beyond what's visible to a simple datum; no matter how symathetic we feel for them as individual, we must study them as a whole.
As women and men of science, we shall put our emotions aside for the greater good. Because places like sjezpz, there are many. All these agglomerations of data---dataset, really---are
interconnected. They are a part of a larger picture; a perpetually expanding galaxy, the Web Of Data.
