So you want to solve real problems? What's the matter with you? Look, everybody does that. It is
too mainstream. People have been doing that forever. Son, what you need to do is to solve problems that don't exist.

Think about the challenge! Everybody can solve real problems, at least they exist. But solving a
problem that doesn't exist? It takes courage. It asks for a vision that goes beyond the senses. It requires tools to reach the distance. Let me tell you how to do it.

First, you need to define clearly your problem. It might seems easy at first, but keep in mind that your problem doesn't exist. I'll leave the details on how to do that for you to figure out (you can take it as your homework.)

Once you have clearly defined your nonexistent problem, you need to find an approach to model it.
The trick here is to visualize the problem. Close your eyes and imagine it right there. Feel it. Try to impersonate him. How does he look like? Work out all the details. Every details. What color is it?  Does it fly? Is it big? Does it squeak when you press it too hard? You might consider taking an abstract sculpting classes and create a clay model, or visiting some modern-art museum for inspiration. Read poems, live the moment. Alternatively, you can drink alcohol.

Don't act too fast. Undefined problems are a volatile kind. Once you think you have figure them
out, they are gone, and you are left with nothing but your clay representation of something that's never been. So take notes and hang them on your walls. Eat fish, it is good for your memory.
Wait until the next morning before starting anything. Your brain has to work things out for you. If you have completely forgotten about your problem when you wake up, you are on the right track.
Consider it being your subconscious saying “I don't have any problem to work out tonight.” Talk
about a proof that your problem really doesn't exist! If you have reached this step, consider it a checkpoint.

OK kid, now bear with me. This step is crucial. Now that you have a clear vision of how unclear
your problem is, it is time to solve it. Even with a precise description of how abstract the structure is, try not to get lost in the details first. What you need to do is to take your problem, and divide it in smaller subproblems. Then you take the subproblems and you divide them in even smaller subproblems. Imagine you're a chef cutting down a cucumber. The cucumber represents your
problem. Kill it! Break it down to pieces. Now put some salt and pepper on it, and eat it. How does it feel? That's the taste of victory. Take some bread with butter if you are still hungry. First you divide, then you conquer. And I want you to be a conquerer, son!

Of course you could elaborate inventions to fulfill your needs, and assemble them into bigger
structures to make possible what nobody thought would be. Everybody could do it! But we don't
fully understand the universe yet. And most of the problems that awaits are still invisible to us. Our intuition would dismiss them. Even if our emotion gets us back to earth, it is crucial to reason beyond a feeling. By solving today the problems you might have tomorrow, you are investing in the future. You are doing mankind a favor.

Girls, money, fame, oh yeah, you'd get it all. Your abstract quest to shed light on problems that don't exist has a lyrical substance. You'll look like a hero to your peers. Ayn Rand would be proud of you. I'm not even talking about the by-products, such as your clay models ending up directly in museums.

Let's take a pause now. Look, I want you to think about what you want to accomplish in your life.
When you are old like me, what would you like to tell your children? Would you like to tell themyou just solved real problems, like anybody? Or would you like to look into their eyes, into their
soul, and tell them that you tackled the unexpected, that you've reached lands nobody ever thought about, that you fought hardly against odds and that you won? That you are the only one who solved problems literally nobody ever imagined.
